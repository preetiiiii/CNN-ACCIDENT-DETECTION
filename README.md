# CNN-ACCIDENT-DETECTION
Traffic accidents pose significant risks to public safety and often result in severe consequences. The rapid detection of accidents is crucial for prompt emergency response and effective traffic management. In this project, we propose a real-time accident detection system based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs have demonstrated remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks, including object detection and classification, making them well-suited for accident detection from surveillance videos.

Our approach involves training a CNN model on a large dataset of labeled video clips containing both accident and non-accident scenarios. The model learns to distinguish between normal traffic flow and abnormal events indicative of accidents. We employ techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance the model's generalization capabilities and efficiency.

Once trained, the CNN model is integrated into a real-time video processing pipeline, enabling continuous monitoring of traffic footage from surveillance cameras. By analyzing spatial and temporal features in the video frames, the model can accurately identify and localize potential accidents as they occur. Upon detection, the system triggers timely alerts to relevant authorities, facilitating prompt response and mitigation of traffic disruptions.

We evaluate the performance of our accident detection system using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately identifying accidents while minimizing false alarms. Real-world deployment of the proposed system has the potential to enhance road safety, reduce response times to accidents, and improve overall traffic management efficiency.
